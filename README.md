# AIPersonCount
AI Person Count with Open CV , Tensforflow with minimum number of code lines. 

Using this few lines , you can do person detection and person count on any youtube video, 

To change the youtube video link, go to python file and replace the youtube link and your youtube file will run and you can see the person count. 
The accuracy is not upto mark. I will add more repos with similar usecases. 

This program detect common objects as Person , Car, Trucks etc and also shows the count of people in each Frame. 
This will need Tensorflow on MacOS, as of Apr 2023, this needs Python < 3.11 , I did with Python 3.10.9
